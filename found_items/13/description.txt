On October 23rd, 2023, I found several textbooks on a table in the Union Building near Wells Fargo Bank. The books include titles such as Physics, Geography, Cultural Anthropology, Essentials of Statistics, Real Skills, Research Strategies, and DSM-IV. None of these books had any names indicated on them.
